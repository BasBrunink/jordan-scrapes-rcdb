# Jordan Scrapes RCDB

This scrapes the [Roller Coaster Database](https://rcdb.com/) for all North American roller coasters. It could easily be adjusted by changing the region url to whatever region you wanted to target based on the url you found on rcdb.com.

After that, you just need to run `npm start` and it'll scrape the games and output the results to the steamApps.csv
